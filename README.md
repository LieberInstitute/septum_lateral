## Interactive websites:

All of these interactive websites are powered by open source software,
namely:

- ðŸ‘€ [`iSEE`](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.14966.1)

We provide the following interactive websites, organized by dataset with
software labeled by emojis:

- snRNA-seq (n = 4)
  - ðŸ‘€
    [snRNAseq_lateral_septum](https://libd.shinyapps.io/snRNAseq_lateral_septum/):
    main website for the snRNA-seq data from this study.
- bulk RNA-seq (n = 8)
  - ðŸ‘€
    [bulkseq_lateral_septum](https://libd.shinyapps.io/bulkseq_lateral_septum/):
    similar to `snRNAseq_lateral_septum`, but for the bulk RNA-seq data.

## Contact

We value public questions, as they allow other users to learn from the
answers. If you have any questions, please ask them at
