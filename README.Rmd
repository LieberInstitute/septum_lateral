## Overview

## Study Design

## Interactive websites:

All of these interactive websites are powered by open source software,
namely:

- ðŸ‘€ [`iSEE`](https://doi.org/10.12688%2Ff1000research.14966.1)

We provide the following interactive websites, organized by dataset with
software labeled by emojis:

- snRNA-seq (n = 4)
  - ðŸ‘€
    [snRNAseq_lateral_septum](https://libd.shinyapps.io/snRNAseq_lateral_septum/): main website for the snRNA-seq data from this study.

## Contact

We value public questions, as they allow other users to learn from the answers. If you have any questions, please ask them at [LieberInstitute/septum_lateral/issues](https://github.com/LieberInstitute/septum_lateral/issues) and refrain from emailing us. Thank you again for your interest in our work!

## Data Access

We highly value open data sharing and believe that doing so accelerates science.

### Processed Data

TODO (by Leo)

### Raw data

The source data is publicly available from the Globus endpoint `jhpce#septum_lateral`, which is also listed at http://research.libd.org/globus.
